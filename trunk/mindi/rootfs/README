README              MINDI LINUX / MONDO RESCUE            February 7th, 2002

For a really groovy boot disk, use Mindi in combination with Mondo Rescue,
which may be found at <http://www.microwerks.net/~hugo>.

This CD (or, this set of floppy disks) contains the tools required to do
basic system maintenance, e.g. formatting, moving files, mounting partitions.

If you used Mondo to make this CD (or set of floppies) then oh boy, are you in
for some fun. To do a basic restore, type:-
# mondo-restore

To edit the mountlist, type:-
# edit-mountlist

The archives can be accessed manually using the afio command, like so:-
# afio -i -P bzip2 -Z /mnt/cdrom/archives/N.afio.bz2
OR
# afio -i -P lzop -Z /mnt/cdrom/archives/N.afio.lzo

Tape archives cannot be accessed directly.

NFS mounts should be made available automatically. If they aren't, use mount
accordingly.

Before you e-mail me, please read the FAQ, the manual, the log and preferably
the mailing list.
