MONITAS
"""""""

Document last updated: June 19th, 2002


WARNING
"""""""

Monitas is alpha-quality code. If it eats you alive, don't blame me. ;)
However, please bear in mind that I am writing and testing it on a daily
basis and I haven't lost any data yet.


INSTALLING
""""""""""

Monitas will not work unless you install Mondo first. Mondo has its own 
dependencies which must be fulfilled before it will run, such as Mindi.
So, before you even try to install Monitas, please install Mondo. Make
sure you are installing the LATEST SNAPSHOT from the website
(http://www.mondorescue.com/download.html).

Unzip the Monitas tarball (the one you've unzipped in order to read
this message). Then, type:-

# cd monitas-0.1a
# ./make-server info
# ./make-client info
# mkdir /root/monitas
# cp -f client,server /root/monitas

(If you have problems later on, repeat the 'make' commands but drop the
'info' parameter from each.)


SERVER
""""""

Because Monitas is alpha-quality code, you should not install it in
/usr/sbin or /usr/local/sbin. Instead, run it from /root:-
# /root/monitas/server info &

To monitor the server, type:-
# tail -f /var/log/monitas/monitas-server.log

To kill the server, type:-
# kill `cat /var/run/monitas-server.pid`

CLIENT
""""""

Then, go to another console and type:-
# /root/monitas/client info 127.0.0.1 &
Replace '127.0.0.1' with the IP address of the PC on which the server runs.

To monitor the client, type:-
# tail -f /var/log/monitas/monitas-client.log

To kill the client, type:-
# kill `cat /var/run/monitas-client.pid`




BACKING UP / COMPARING / RESTORING
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

To backup, compare or restore /usr/local, please go to the
server's console and type one of these:-
# echo "backup 127.0.0.1 /usr/local" > /var/spool/monitas/server-input.dev
# echo "compare 127.0.0.1 /usr/local" > /var/spool/monitas/server-input.dev
# echo "restore 127.0.0.1 /usr/local" > /var/spool/monitas/server-input.dev

To do it while sitting at the client PC, type one of these:-
# echo "backup /usr/local" > /var/spool/monitas/client-input.dev
# echo "compare /usr/local" > /var/spool/monitas/client-input.dev
# echo "restore /usr/local" > /var/spool/monitas/client-input.dev

By default, files are restored to /mnt/RESTORING. To restore to the / dir,
enter the following at the client's console:-
# echo "restore /usr/local /" > /var/spool/monitas/client-input.dev
or this on the server's console:-
# echo "restore 127.0.0.1 /usr/local /" > /var/spool/monitas/server-input.dev
