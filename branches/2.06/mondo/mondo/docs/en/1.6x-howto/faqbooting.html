   <A NAME="AEN601"></A><B>Q: </B>How do I know if Mondo works with my 
   Linux distro?</P>
  <P ALIGN=LEFT>
   <B>A: </B>Try running it. :) That's always a good way to find out. 
   Check the <A HREF="../../docs/docs.html" TARGET="_top">Documentation page</A>,
    too.</P>
  <P ALIGN=LEFT>
   <A NAME="AEN607"></A><B>Q: </B>When I try to boot from the Mondo CD, 
   it says, &quot;VFS: Unable to mount root fs.&quot; I am using a 
   Debian distro. What do I do?</P>
  <P ALIGN=LEFT>
   <B>A: </B>Ask Debian's designers why they, unlike every other distro 
   I can find, have included cramfs and other 'goodies' with their 
   kernel. In the meantime, please use '-k FAILSAFE' in your command 
   line when calling Mondo.</P>
  <P ALIGN=LEFT>
   <A NAME="AEN612"></A><B>Q: </B>When I try to boot from the Mondo CD, 
   it says, &quot;Cannot mount root fs - kernel panic,&quot; or 
   something similar. What do I do?</P>
  <P ALIGN=LEFT>
   <B>A: </B>Recompile your kernel (or use '-k FAILSAFE'). Take a look 
   at <A HREF="kernelsupport.html">Linux Kernel support</A> to see what 
   you're kernel must support.</P>
  <P ALIGN=LEFT>
   <A NAME="AEN618"></A><B>Q: </B>When I try to boot from the Mondo CD, 
   it says, &quot;UPGRADE YOUR RAM&quot;. What does that mean?</P>
  <P ALIGN=LEFT>
   <B>A: </B>Recompile your kernel and add Virtual memory file system 
   support. Take a look at <A HREF="kernelsupport.html">Linux Kernel support</A> 
   to see what you're kernel must support. (Of course, if your PC has 
   less than 64MB of RAM, you could always... what's the phrase? I know, 
   upgrade your RAM!)</P>
  <P ALIGN=LEFT>
   <A NAME="AEN624"></A><B>Q: </B>When I try to boot from the Mondo CD, 
   it says something about not finding my CD-ROM drive and then it 
   blames the kernel. What does that mean?</P>
  <P ALIGN=LEFT>
   <B>A: </B>Your kernel must support initrd, loopfs, IDE CD-ROM's, and 
   ramdisks. Take a look at <A HREF="kernelsupport.html">Linux Kernel support</A> 
   to see what you're kernel must support. If your kernel does not 
   support these things, Mondo will not boot from your CD. However, when 
   running Mindi, you may choose to use _its_ kernel instead of your 
   own. In addition, you may boot from floppy disk images instead the 
   CD: copy the disk images from the CD /images directory to floppy 
   disks, using 'dd'. Take a look at <A HREF="faqbooting.html#COPYBOOTDATADISK">Copy
    boot data disks</A> on how to make those.</P>
  <P ALIGN=LEFT>
   <A NAME="AEN631"></A><B>Q: </B>The Mondo CD/floppy takes ages to 
   boot. How can I speed it up?</P>
  <P ALIGN=LEFT>
   <B>A: </B>Edit mindi (it's a shell script, btw) and change 
   LILO_OPTIONS=&quot;&quot; to LILO_OPTIONS=&quot;-c&quot;. This 
   enables map compaction in lilo and speeds up booting, for more info 
   see the lilo man page.</P>
  <P ALIGN=LEFT>
   <A NAME="AEN636"></A><B>Q: </B>I made a Mondo CD using the failsafe 
   kernel (i.e. I said 'no' when Mondo asked if I wanted to use my own 
   kernel). It still doesn't boot. Help!</P>
  <P ALIGN=LEFT>
   <B>A: </B>OK, now <I>that</I> is a bug. :-) I included a kernel with 
   Mondo (technically, with Mindi, which Mondo uses) to make sure that 
   users could use Mondo despite flaws in their own kernels. If you are 
   using Mondo/Mindi's kernel but still cannot boot from your Mondo CD 
   then please e-mail the list.</P>
  <P ALIGN=LEFT>
   <A NAME="AEN641"></A><B>Q: </B>What if my PC won't boot from a CD?</P>
  <P ALIGN=LEFT>
   <B>A: </B>Copy the image files from the CD /images directory, using 
   the dd command. Take a look at <A HREF="faqbooting.html#COPYBOOTDATADISK">Copy
    boot data disks</A> on how to make those. Then boot from the first 
   floppy; follow it up with the data disks; finally, type 'mount 
   /mnt/cdrom' and then utilize the restore script as usual, e.g. mondorestore.</P>
  <P ALIGN=LEFT>
   <A NAME="AEN647"></A><B>Q: </B>But why won't Mondo boot from my CD? 
   It says my kernel is flawed/outdated/ whatever, and when I wrote to 
   you, you told me the same thing... but I still don't get it. I mean, 
   my kernel works for everything else. Why not Mondo?</P>
  <P ALIGN=LEFT>
   <B>A: </B>Because Mondo makes a boot disk using your kernel. I bet 
   your other software doesn't do that. Also, not all kernels are 
   suitable for boot disks. I'm sorry but that's Life. Upgrade your 
   kernel and/or recompile it. Take a look at <A HREF="kernelsupport.html">Linux
    Kernel support</A> to see what you're kernel must support.</P>
  <P ALIGN=LEFT>
   <A NAME="AEN653"></A><B>Q: </B>Why do I only need a boot disk if I'm 
   using a tape drive? Where are the data disks?</P>
  <P ALIGN=LEFT>
   <B>A: </B>On the tape. :-) The first 32MB of the tape will be set 
   aside for a large tarball containing the data disks, a list of all 
   files backed up, and other sundries. If Mondo and Mindi do their 
   respective jobs then you won't need additional floppies, just the 
   boot floppy and the tape(s).</P>
  <P ALIGN=LEFT>
   <A NAME="AEN658"></A><B>Q: </B>Why does it say, &quot;Process 
   accounting FAILED&quot; when I reboot?</P>
  <P ALIGN=LEFT>
   <B>A: </B>You were using Process Accounting. Red Hat (or whichever 
   distro you are using) does not provide a startup/shutdown script yet. 
   So, when you try to backup the process log, it just grows and grows 
   as Mondo tries to back it up. Mondo doesn't back it up anymore and 
   that's why. The unfortunate side-effect is... well, what you see on 
   your screen. Type 'touch /var/log/pacct' and then 'paccton' to fix 
   the error message.</P>
  <P ALIGN=LEFT>
   <A NAME="AEN663"></A><B>Q: </B>Why does it say, 
   &amp;#8220;request_module[block-major-1]: Root fs not mounted VFS: 
   Cannot open root device &quot;100&quot; or 01:00 Please append a 
   correct &quot;root=&quot; boot option kernel panic: VFS: Unable to 
   mount root fs on 01:00&amp;#8221; when i boot from the CD?</P>
  <P ALIGN=LEFT>
   <B>A: </B>Recompile your kernel and add initrd support. Take a look 
   at <A HREF="kernelsupport.html">Linux Kernel support</A>to see what 
   you're kernel must support.</P>
  <P ALIGN=LEFT>
   <A NAME="COPYBOOTDATADISK"></A><B>Q: </B>How do i copy boot+data disk 
   images to physical floppy disks ?</P>
  <P ALIGN=LEFT>
   <B>A: </B>The images are in /root/images/mindi (eve if they are 
   created by Mondo) and also in the 'images' directory on the first CD 
   of your backup set, if you have backed up to CD. You can copy the 
   images to disk as follows:-</P>

   <P ALIGN=LEFT>
    <DT CLASS="mvd-P"><B>A:</B> Play with 'mt'. Use its setblksize and 
    defblksize switches to reconfigure your tape drive if necessary. Some 
    tape drives just suck, I'm sorry to say. If yours is one of them then 
    God help you. Mondo can handle any tape drive whose drive and 
    firmware can handle fread(), fwrite(), fread() and fclose(). Mondo 
    uses standard C libraries to talk to your tape streamer. If your tape 
    streamer can't handle that then you had better call a priest. Either 
    that or ask for a refund.</P>
