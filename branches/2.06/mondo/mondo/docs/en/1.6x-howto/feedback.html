   document in a separate e-mail to the mailing list. Join the mailing 
   list at <A HREF="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/mondo-devel">http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/mondo-devel</A>;

   Please note that we do our best to help everyone but it is difficult 
   for us to help you if you do not attach a log file to your e-mail. 
   Let me say that again - <FONT SIZE="7">attach your log file to your 
   e-mail! </FONT>Thank you. Without it, we can only wave our hands and 
   say, &quot;Well, it could be this or it could be that,&quot; and we 
   can't offer any tangible help because you aren't either. That's what 
   the log file is for. It is located at /var/log/mondo-archive.log; 
   please use gzip to compress it before attaching it, or it will be too 
   big for the mailing list.</P>

   <B>Re: punctuation and spelling</B></P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   I was born and raised in England. I spent three years in the USA, 
   where I picked up some of the associated spelling, etc. Much of 
   Mondo's development took place in the US; so, rather than confuse 
   matters, I am keeping all source code and documentation in US 
   English. All criticisms should be made with that in mind.</P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   When I was at school, the apostrophe would be present when 
   pluralizing an acronym - e.g. CD's, ISO's - but nowadays that is 
   considered old hat and even incorrect by some, which came as a shock 
   to me when I found out. It surprises me how quickly grammar, spelling 
   and punctuation have evolved even during my brief liefetime. I am 
   afraid I am still in the habit of writing CD's instead of CDs. If you 
   would like to draw my attention to technical, grammatical or 
   typographical errors, please feel free but remember to couch your 
   e-mail in language which shows you are doing this out of a spirit of 
   compassion for the poor sods who have to read the documentation, not 
   out of a spirit of pedantry. :)</P>
