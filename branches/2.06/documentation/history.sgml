<sect1 id="HISTOR"><title>3.5. Mondo Rescue and Mindi Linux
History</title>
<para>Mondo Rescue was created in December 1999 as a utility to
clone Linux/Windows installations. Norton Ghost would not do the
job, and my boss wanted to jump on the Linux bandwagon. So, I wrote
a few scripts and shoehorned them into the latest Linux-Mandrake
CD. Since that time, Mondo grew into a disaster recovery suite for
Linux and Windows. Mondo forced me to learn about the kernel, its
initrd initial ramdisk, modules, library dependencies, disk
partitioning, and the myriad differences between the Top 10 Linux
distributions.</para>
<para>The first formal release was made on February 18th, 2000.
Mondo is currently one of the top five Linux backup/restore
programs. Mondo has been compared favorably to ArcServe, Arkeia and
BRU. Although Mondo lacks the more advanced, enterprise-level
features of ArcServe and Arkeia, for workstations and small- to
medium-size servers it is ideal because it is small, fast,
efficient, stable, comes with source code, and is being actively
developed and supported.</para>
