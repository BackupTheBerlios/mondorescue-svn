   <A NAME="AEN822"></A><B>Q: </B>Can Mondo help me 
   move/resize/re-allocate my partitions?</P>
  <P ALIGN=LEFT>
   <B>A: </B>Yes. Just backup your system in Interactive Mode using 
   Mondo. Edit the mountlist when prompted.</P>
  <P ALIGN=LEFT>
   <A NAME="AEN827"></A><B>Q: </B>My zip drive is a SCSI drive. When I 
   restore, Mondo craps out, saying it can't mount the drive (because 
   there is no disk in it). What do I do?</P>
  <P ALIGN=LEFT>
   <B>A: </B>Restore in Interactive Mode. Delete the SCSI drive from the 
   mountlist before you restore. Then Mondo won't try to partition or 
   format it. Next time you backup, use -E /dev/sdd (or whatever your 
   zip drive is). The /dev entry will be excluded from the mountlist but 
   not from the filelist. So, when you restore, you won't accidentally 
   reformat your zip disk. However, after restoring, you will find that 
   /dev/sdd (the _file_) will still be present in your /dev directory. 
   Cool, eh?</P>

   <A NAME="AEN832"></A><B>Q: </B>I received a message like, 'Fileset 
   NNN failed' during restore. What does it mean.</P>
  <P ALIGN=LEFT>
   <B>A: </B>It usually means either you had a very large (&gt;2GB) file 
   which was not archived owing to a flaw in your distro or your 
   filesystem has changed in relation to the backup.</P>
  <P ALIGN=LEFT>
   <A NAME="AEN837"></A><B>Q: </B>Why does my ext3 partition have less 
   space free than when I backed it up?</P>
  <P ALIGN=LEFT>
   <B>A: </B>Mondo creates a 10MB journal file area. Your journal was 
   probably smaller than that, hence the difference.</P>

    booting from the CD/floppies, I sometimes get errors like, 
    &quot;Running out of memory&quot; or &quot;Segmentation fault&quot;. 
    What is going on?</P>
   <P ALIGN=LEFT>
    <DT CLASS="mvd-P"><B>A:</B> It sounds as if you are running out of 
    disk space, probably ram disk space. Type 'df -m' to see which 
    partitions are running low on space. Please send as much information 
    as you can to the mailing list. This problem is believed to have been 
    fixed in 1.63 and 1.71.</P>

   <A NAME="LVM"></A><B>Q:</B> I can't nuke-restore my LVM or RAID or 
   LVM-on-RAID setup. I have to do it manually. What now?</P>
  <P ALIGN=LEFT>
   <B>A: </B>You said it yourself. You have to do it manually. :) Sorry 
   but that's about it. At least you have all the tools to do it. I 
   assume you know how. If you don't, look at i-want-my-lvm (a script on 
   the ramdisk) if you're using LVM. It should give you a few clues. 
   RAID is harder but in general Mondo's RAID support is good. After 
   you've prepped and formatted your drives, run mondorestore again but 
   say 'no' when asked if you want Mondo to prep or format your drives.</P>
