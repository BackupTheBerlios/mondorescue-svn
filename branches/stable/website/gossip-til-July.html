sake, not even a shortcut to <I>awk</I>, so goodness knows what else

fact, I ported almost all of the restore-side code to C. I have found 
the new program - 'mondo-restore' - to be fast and reliable. However, 
if you have any problems, the old scripts (prep-me, restore-me, etc.) 
will be on the ramdisk at restore-time if you need them.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

a cautionary tale. Either my CD writer malfunctioned or the CDRW

I think, which caused one of the tarballs to be irretrievable. So, I 
restored from an older backup and downloaded the changed files from 
the Web (the changed files being Mondo and Mindi *g*). So, folks, do 
run that Compare Mode cycle, just to be sure your backup is good.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

only rational attitude I have found is to regard the American left- 
and right-wing ideologies as economic in basis, and that anything 
else is done to win votes. The Democrats get the black vote because 
most people think the Republican party is racist. The Republicans get 
the Christian vote because most people think the Democrats are a 
bunch of godless pedants. (I wonder who black Christians vote for? 
Maybe they don't...)</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

ba-ack! Lots of bugfixes to roll into the next release. I want to do 
something with 2.4 because it allows for a variable-size ramdisk, 
specified at boot-time. That would mean 2.4 users could use their own 
kernel, modules, tools, etc. when creating Mondo's boot disks. It 
could even open the door to a multi-floppy mini-distro based on the 
user's own system.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
