		<h1>About Mondo Rescue</h1>
  <div class="h2-1">
    <h2>What is Mondo Rescue ?</h2>
  </div>
  <p>
       <B>Mondo is reliable.</B> It backs up your GNU/Linux server or 
       workstation to tape, CD-R, CD-RW, DVD-R[W], DVD+R[W], NFS or hard disk partition. In the 
       event of catastrophic data loss, you will be able to restore all of 
       your data [or as much as you want], from bare metal if necessary. 
	   Mondo is in use by Lockheed-Martin, Nortel Networks, Siemens, HP, 
	   IBM, NASA's JPL, the US Dept of Agriculture, dozens of 
       smaller companies, and tens of thousands of users.</P>

	   <p>
       <B>Mondo is comprehensive.</B> Mondo supports LVM 1/2, RAID, ext2, ext3, 
       JFS, XFS, ReiserFS, VFAT, and can support additional filesystems 
       easily: just e-mail the <A HREF="/support.shtml">mailing list</A> 
	   with your request. It supports software raid as well as most hardware raid controllers. It supports adjustments in disk geometry, 
       including migration from non-RAID to RAID. Mondo runs on all major 
       Linux distributions (RedHat, RHEL, SuSE, SLES, Mandriva, Debian) and is getting better all the time. You may even 
       use it to backup non-Linux partitions, such as NTFS.</P>
	   <p>
       <B>Mondo is free!</B> It has been published under the GPL v2 (GNU Public 
       License), partly to expose it to thousands of potential beta-testers 
       but mostly as a contribution to the Linux community. 
       </P>

		  <h2>The Mondo Rescue Community</h2>
  </div>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	  There are dozens of regular <a href="/thanks.shtml">contributors</a> and over 400 members of the mailing list. The user base is estimated at between 50,000 and 100,000.</P>
      <P>
	  Mondo Rescue was first created because there was nothing like 
	  it available at that time under a free license. Nowadays, 
       Mondo is not the only good, free disaster recovery solution for 
       Linux. You may wish to try <A HREF="http://mkcdrec.ota.be"><B>mkcdrec</B></A>.
        The software has been in existence for almost as long as Mondo, it 
       supports the same filesystems (including RAID and LVM), and its 
       author is friendly and helpful.</P>
