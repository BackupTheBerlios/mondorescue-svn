am going back to England in under three months. It would be selfish

technically I could sleep with a woman if I wanted ('technically' 
because I'm not looking hard and I'm not sure I'm particularly 
appealing). However, I really don't think it would be ethical for me 
to do that. As a good friend of mine put it to me recently, men say 
they don't have a problem with one-night stands but they do; and, as 
I said in response, I tend to fall in love with the women that I 
sleep with. That is one reason I am so picky: it is a form of self-defense.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

first was a mistake and the second one I married (draw your own 
conclusions about that one!). I am not emotionally backward; I am not 
frigid; I am not afraid of women. I love women's company. It's just 
that until I met my wife, I didn't have the guts to come out and say, 
&quot;Okay, [your name], I think you're absolutely adorable, you're

muster the courage to say, &quot;If I told you I thought you were 
fascinating, intelligent, warm, kind and a lot of fun to be around, a 
great person to be with,... what would you say?&quot; She beamed but 
said nothing. She has told me in the past that she loves my company, 
that I am 'precious' and very sweet, and frankly I am content with

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial,Times New I2"><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT COLOR="BLACK">It

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial,Times New I2"><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT COLOR="BLACK">In
additional, she is not a Black American: she is Liberian. A lot of

think they're so special, so much better than us.&quot; (Us = Black

<FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial,Times New I2"><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT COLOR="BLACK">I
get stick from a few Black friends for trying to hard to &quot;be 
Black&quot;. My wife is not Black, she is Liberian. So, if anything, 
I am trying to be Liberian... only I'm not trying, of course. Africa 
is made up of several countries, each of which has different tribes 
and languages. Black Americans are Black Americans because the 
culture was homogenized after years and years of you-know-what. 
Likewise, a lot of White Americans parade down the street once a year 
dressed in green and call themselves Irish. Bollocks. My grandmother 
was Irish and I do not call myself Irish, nor to I talk about my 
&quot;Irish roots&quot;. I was born and raised in England. I am 
English. I love and respect Ireland as part of Great Britain but I am 
not Irish. I am more Liberian than I am Irish, and you don't see me

<FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial,Times New I2"><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT COLOR="BLACK">Ironically,
the same friend that said, &quot;Africans think they're all 
that,&quot; also vilified me for saying Irish Americans aren't really 
Irish. She said, &quot;What do you know about culture? About what it 
means to be away from your homeland? About how you define yourself by 
where you're from, not where you are now?&quot; Well, duh. I moved 
3000 miles to be with the woman I loved. I think I know the 
difference between culture and nationality.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial,Times New I2"><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT COLOR="BLACK">She
was also the woman who accused me of looking at my customers (when I 
ran a computer store) and judging them by their skin color. She said 
I saw a typical Black man as &quot;just another nigger.&quot; 
Incidentally, she told me - as a compliment, I am sure - that I was 
the only White man she had ever had at her house. To cut a long 
story, short, it became apparent that I knew the difference between 
being Black and being 'ghetto', and she didn't. My wife backs me to 
the hilt on this point. (Jeanette and I are still close friends, by 
the grace of God.)</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial,Times New I2"><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT COLOR="BLACK">So,
on the one hand, I feel it is right and proper for me to embrace my 
wife's culture. She feels the same way. However, I do occasionally 
get in trouble for unwittingly using &quot;Black slang&quot;. I am 
not sure which slang is Black and which slang is White (or Hispanic 
or whatever) and frankly I resent the idea that certain expression 
are the preserve of one social or ethnic group. That smacks of

I'm assumed either not to care or not to be subject to it at all. 
&quot;Oh no, Hugo, we mean those <I>other</I> immigrants. You're

White Americans that are that way. Never mind. I'll be gone soon. I

Mindi, is usually at fault when the CD will not boot; users should 
copy their floppy disk images to floppy disks and boot from those. If 
your kernel cannot boot from a CD, it means something is wrong with 
the kernel; if you do not have the time or energy to fix your kernel, 
please boot from floppy disks.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

v1.10 came out today.The restore engine now uses newt instead of 
ncurses. I think it looks much nicer now. You be the judge. The new 
version includes some minor bugfixes. See CHANGES for details. Mindi 
v0.37, which was released today, has some bugfixes of its own.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

than the ugly old ncurses-based interface. My thanks go to Red Hat 
for their work on the newt and slang libraries.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

know, the funny thing about mailing lists is that people spend more 
time bickering with each other than helping inquisitive newbies. This 
leads me to believe that the loudest voices in the Red Hat mailing 
list are not the wisest but the most insecure. It is pointless to get 
into arguments with individuals in private if the bone of contention 
is the accuracy of the information a person is giving; it is wiser, 
surely, to tell the person asking the question, &quot;Look, I think X 
is wrong, I think I'm right,&quot; then everyone else can chime in.

Granz has sent me a couple of neat bugfixes for the restore scripts.

v1.09 contains a few minor bugfixes to v1.08; Mindi v0.36 contains a

distros, you will know what I mean. If you haven't, well, please 
don't whine if Mondo runs okay on Red Hat 7.1 but not on Dinky Dorky 2.3r4.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
