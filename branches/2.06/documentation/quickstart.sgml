Choose from the list of supported backup media types. The media you
will use most often are CD-R, CD-RW, tape, NFS and hard disk. If
you want to backup/restore over a network, choose 'NFS'. If you
want to backup/restore to/from a local partition or if you simply
want to store the ISO images in a local directory until you have
time or facilities to burn them to CD's, choose 'hard disk'. If you
choose 'CD-R[W]' or 'tape' then in general your hardware will be
detected and configured for you.

If you are backing up to CD-R[W] then Mondo will ask you if your CD
burner has BurnProof technology, is inside a laptop, or is
otherwise eccentric. If you are backing up to a tape streamer then
you will not see this message.

How much compression do you want? None, if your tape streamer has
built-in hardware compression. Maximum, if your CPU is blazingly
fast. Average should do just fine for most situations.

If you want to backup the whole computer (excluding /tmp and /proc,
naturally) then leave this as / which is the default. Otherwise,
specify subsets, (e.g. /usr/local /home ) being sure to put a space
in between each path.

If you are backing up your whole computer then you might want to
exclude certain directories, e.g. /shared/MP3. Please specify them
in the 'exclude directories' dialog box. Please put a space in
between each path, e.g. /shared/private /scratch /nfs /windows

Is your kernel sane? Red Hat, Mandrake, SuSE and Slackware users
should in general say 'yes' because these vendors are good at
producing reliable kernels. If you are using Debian, Gentoo or LFS
then your kernel might be non-standard, in which case say 'no' to
use Mondo's failsafe kernel.

Linux distribution, say 'no'... and a little prayer.

If you are sure you want to go ahead, say 'yes' and find something
else to do while Mondo backs up your computer. If you say 'no' then
you will be unceremoniously dumped at the shell prompt. :-)

The backup process will now commence. There are some pre-backup
tasks to be carried out first but the backup is essentially
underway. To simplify the backup process, you were asked a series
of questions. Next time, if you like, you could call mondoarchive
with various command-line switches to control its behavior, instead
of answering a series of questions. See the man page for details.

Mondo will make a catalog of all files to be backed up. This may
take up to five minutes. The list of files will be divided into
sets, approximately 4 MB (before compression) of files per set.
This typically takes one minute.

Mondo calls Mindi. Mindi generates bootable floppy disk images and
auxiliary data disk images which are based on your existing Linux
distribution and filesystem. That way, you can be sure Mondo's
tools will be compatible with your existing filesystems and
binaries: Mondo's tools are your tools. Mindi takes up to five
minutes to run.

Finally, Mondo begins backing up your computer. This process may
take a few minutes or a few hours, depending on how much data you
are archiving, how fast your CPU is, how much RAM you have, and so
on. It will backup your regular files and then your large files
(files larger than approximately 32MB). If you have opted to verify
your backups, Mondo will do that too.

Do you want to create a boot floppy at the end? Yes, if you're a
tape or NFS user. No, if you are using CD-R[W]'s and your computer
supports bootable CD's. Tape users only need one floppy but other
users may need more. Mondo will advise accordingly.

<para>When making a backup on a live system, there will always be
processes running that will write out data on the system after you
have made the backup and before you have made the compare, this
will result in difference showing up when comparing your backup.

read this section.</para>

<para>The 'c' means you must be writing to CD-Rs, not CD-RWs (the
latter would require 'w' instead of 'c'). The '4' is the speed of
your CD writer. The string after -I is the path to be backed up.
The '-gF' means you are going to see the pretty yellow-on-blue
screen instead of the boring white-on-black screen. :) It also
means Mondo will not offer to create physical boot floppies for
you. It is assumed that you are able to boot from the CD which
Mondo has generated.</para>

<para>Note that you have to mount the NFS partition, backup to it,
unmount it, and create a boot CD to allow you to restore from
scratch if necessary. To reassure yourself that you will be able to
restore from the NFS share even if your PC is wiped, please boot
from the Mindi CD and type 'compare'. The on-screen instructions
from that point on should be sufficient.</para>

<para>In this case, we assume Syslinux is incompatible with your
boot media. For some reason, some BIOSes just don't like Syslinux.
If you find this to be the case for your computer, please use '-L'
to force Mondo to use LILO instead of Syslinux as the boot loader
for its CD/floppies. (NB: This has nothing to do with which boot
loader your hard drive uses.) Also, it is a good habit to specify
your tape streamer with '-d &lt;device&gt;'. You don't usually need
to but it's good to be on the safe side. Some computers call your
tape streamer /dev/osst0, some call it /dev/ftape, ...</para>
