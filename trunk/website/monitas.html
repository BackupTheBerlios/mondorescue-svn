Latest Monitas tarball is available <A HREF="monitas/monitas-0.1a.tgz">here</A>.
Use it in conjunction with the latest daily snapshot. It lets you 
backup, compare and restore archives over a network.</P>

Latest Monitas tarball is available <A HREF="monitas/monitas-0.1a.tgz">here</A>.
It is alpha-quality code but it works. I can backup, compare and 
restore over a network. It doesn't nuke yet but it works fine on a 
live filesystem. (It restores to /mnt/TESTING as a precaution.)</P>
<P>
Monitas-server (daemon) is 25% complete.</P>
<P>
Monitas-client (daemon) is 40% complete.</P>
<P>
The CLI's, the GUI's and the start/stop wrappers are still in my 
head. :)</P>

<A NAME="FAQ"></A>FAQ</H2>
<P>
<I>Q: What is Monitas?</I></P>
<P>
A: It isn't ready for public consumption yet but it will be by 02/Q4. 
It will backup and restore over a network. It will let the sysadm 
backup, restore, wipe, and even prep from bare metal the PCs residing 
on the network, all from the comfort of the sysadm's console. Data 
backup/restoration may be requested by the client application. Data 
may be restored without the client having to lift a finger. The 
sysadm can run the show from the server.</P>
<P>
I'm going to use this web page as a place where the plan can 
crystallize. Over time, this page will grow into a logical 
explanation of the inner workings of Monitas. This will make it 
easier for others to contribute. It will also help me: I can't write 
half of what Monitas requires :) but I am a quick study and I prefer 
to study in small chunks.</P>
<P>
<I>Q: Will Monitas be Open Source?</I></P>
<P>
A: Yes. The server and client are made available under the GNU Public License.</P>
<P>
<I>Q: Are you crazy? How can you write good software and give it away?</I></P>
<P>
A: Well, I hope someone will see Monitas (and Mondo and Mindi) and 
hire me. I am a UK citizen (technically, a 'subject' because we have 
a monarchy but no-one pays much attention to them nowadays) dating a 
Texan. It is very hard to find a job if you do not have a Green Card. 
It would be immoral to ask Michelle to marry me for any reason other 
than love. Therefore, I am looking high and low for any means to 
support myself while I date her. We shall eventually marry and remain 
in the States but in the meantime, I am having to watch my 
expenditure carefully.</P>
<P>
Why does this affect you? Well, if you use my software regularly but 
don't pay for it, then eventually I'll have to stop developing it. Of 
course, you'll probably find another $0 program to replace mine, so 
you won't care, but I would rather keep Mondo going for you and the 
tens of thousands of users like you, who rely on Mondo.</P>
<P>
Monitas will be better than Mondo. Monitas will use Mondo but for 
client/server network backup and maintenance. If you work for a 
company which uses my software on a regular basis, please consider 
contributing to the project financially or with source patches. How 
else can the project keep going?</P>
<P>
So, yes, I'm crazy. :-) I actually believe people are willing to 
support projects like this one, especially if they are using it daily anyway.</P>
<P>
<I>Q: Why should commercial users pay for Monitas?</I></P>
<P>
A: If you don't support the project, you can't expect me to offer you 
1-to-1 technical support.</P>

The client is coming along nicely. So is the server. It'll be 
September before beta-testing commences but the alpha code is already available.</P>
<H3>
Server</H3>
<P>
The server will come in three parts - the daemon, the CLI 
(command-line interface), and the GUI. The server will keep an SQL 
database of backup information, so that the sysadm can orchestrate 
the smooth backup/restore of data over the network.</P>
<P>
The daemon will check its schedule once a minute. (The schedule will 
be a simple text file, to avoid the need to interrogate the SQL 
database 60 times an hour.) If a backup is due to commence now, the 
daemon sends a signal to the client, asking it to begin archiving and 
submitting data for storage. The daemon then receives the data, 
stores it, labels it and indexes it in the SQL database.</P>
<P>
If a restore event is requested by the sysadm (or if it is 
scheduled), the daemon tells the client to prepare to receive data. 
The daemon then sends the data and tells the client to reboot if 
necessary (before or after is determined by the nature of the 
scheduled/requested event).</P>
<P>
The CLI allows the sysadm to schedule and request events. It will be 
a no-frills interface to the SQL database (and the text file 
containing the backup schedule). Because the daemon is controlled by 
one text file and an SQL database, it is easy to write a client for 
it. So, a GUI should be no problem. I could even write an interface 
in PHP... :^)</P>
<P>
The CLI and GUI are really not that hard. The daemon is the hard 
part. In theory, I could Open the CLI and GUI, just for the heck of 
it. The daemon, no way.</P>
<H3>
Client</H3>
<P>
The client will respond to triggers sent by the server. It will 
backup and restore noninteractively over the network. Like the 
server, the client will come in three parts - the daemon, the CLI, 
and the GUI.</P>
<P>
The daemon will wait until it is asked to backup/restore. Then, it 
backs up / restores. Simple.</P>
<P>
The CLI will interrogate the daemon. It will permit the client's user 
to place a request with the syadm for a backup/restore operation. 
If/when the sysadm okays it then the backup/restore will proceed.</P>
<P>
The GUI will do a prettier job than the CLI. That's about it. The 
client is pretty much a self-cleaning oven.</P>

<A NAME="original_email"></A>How it started</H2>
<P>
<I>Here is the original e-mail, sent to the Mondo mailing list on 
April 26th, 2002:-</I></P>
<P>
We've been kicking some ideas around in #mondo 
(irc.openprojects.net). Here is what we have come up with.</P>
<P>
Think, &quot;Client/server backup with an attitude&quot;. This will 
be Linux-only for now but we could port to Windows in future, in theory.</P>
<P>
Mondo Server (hereafter, &quot;MS&quot;) will:-</P>
<UL>
<LI CLASS="mvd-P">
<P>
accept requests to backup Mondo Clients (hereafter, &quot;MCs&quot;)<BR>
<LI CLASS="mvd-P">accept requests to restore live to MCs<BR>
<LI CLASS="mvd-P">send Reboot&amp;Restore trigger to MCs<BR>
<LI CLASS="mvd-P">send &quot;backup to me&quot; triggers to MCs<BR>
<LI CLASS="mvd-P">send &quot;restore live from me&quot; triggers to MCs<BR>
<LI CLASS="mvd-P">keep a database of ISOs and their info, in a format 
which makes it easy for the sysadm to figure out:-
<UL>
<LI CLASS="mvd-P">when was _this_ MC last backed up?<BR>
<LI CLASS="mvd-P">how old is our most recent backup of 
/home/hugo/personal/letter-to-girlfriend.doc (or whatever)?<BR>
<LI CLASS="mvd-P">when is _this_ MC next due to be backed up?<BR>
<LI CLASS="mvd-P">...etc.</UL>
<LI CLASS="mvd-P">&nbsp;store MCs' backups on device (tape, CD, hard 
disks, etc.) controlled by MS, not the MCs</P>
</UL>
<P>
Mondo Client (daemon running on the 'client', a workstation PC) will:-</P>
<UL>
<LI CLASS="mvd-P">
<P>
receive triggers from MS<BR>
<LI CLASS="mvd-P">backup PC in response to MS's trigger<BR>
<LI CLASS="mvd-P">send ISO's to MS<BR>
<LI CLASS="mvd-P">restore live data streamed from MS to local PC, in

<LI CLASS="mvd-P">reboot&amp;restore from bare metal noninteractively 
in response to request from MS; restore data from MS to MC<BR>
<LI CLASS="mvd-P">send request to MS, asking for a particular 
directory to be restored to MC (or for a bare-metal restore, if desired)</P>
</UL>
<P>
If you invoke mondoserver (the server program) with -d then it will 
run in daemon mode. It will trigger backups in accordance with its 
configuration. I expect that the MS will be configured to start 
mondoserver at boot-time and to shut it down on reboot/shutdown.</P>
<P>
If you invoke mondoclient (the client program) with -d then it will 
run in daemon mode. It will respond to triggers received from the MS. 
I expect that the MCs will be configured to start mondoclient at 
boot-time, etc.</P>
<P>
If you run mondoserver without parameters then it will give you a 
warm, friendly interface with which to configure your MS.</P>
<P>
If you run mondoclient without parameters then it will give you a 
warm, friendly interface to let you watch what mondoclient (the 
daemon) is doing to your MC. You may push a button to request that 
your MC be backed up. The MS will decide whether to give you what you 
want. (The request will probably sit in a special &quot;The user 
asked for this&quot; queue, where the sysadm can see how often you've 
requested it, whether you should have it, etc.)</P>
<P>
Here are the bits I know how to do:-</P>
<UL>
<LI CLASS="mvd-P">
<P>
[MS] store MCs' backups on device (tape, CD, hard disks, etc.) 
controlled by MS, not the MCs<BR>
<LI CLASS="mvd-P">[MC] backup the local PC in response to MS's trigger<BR>
<LI CLASS="mvd-P">[MC] reboot&amp;restore from bare metal (without a 
floppy or a CD) over a network</P>
</UL>
<P>
I haven't figured out these bits yet:-</P>
<UL>
<LI CLASS="mvd-P">
<P>
[MS] send triggers to MCs<BR>
<LI CLASS="mvd-P">[MC] receive triggers from MS<BR>
<LI CLASS="mvd-P">[MS] keep a database of ISOs and their info, in a 
format which makes it easy for the sysadm to track backups<BR>
<LI CLASS="mvd-P">[MC/MS] send data back &amp; forth (the backups 
themselves, I mean) &lt;--- netcat?</P>
</UL>
<P>
Basically, I know very little about networking but I can learn. I 
also don't own any networked PC's (well, I do but they're 3000 miles 
away). So, I have to do some serious thinking. I can buy some cheap, 
used PC's and network them; use them as testbeds/clients; buy a 
slightly more expensive PC as a server; then I can go from there. I 
expect to do it for &lt;$1500. My apartment hasn't sold yet, so I 
can't start the heavy coding until then. I expect to start within a 
month, though.</P>
<P>
I _think_ I can do this by the end of the year. If I'm lucky, I can 
have most of this running reliably by August/September.</P>
<P>
I know there are some fairly big companies which use Mondo. I know 
some of their employees are on this list. If you think you know 
someone who would be interested in sponsoring the client/server phase 
of Mondo, please let me know.</P>
<P>
There are 3 or 4 hardcore developers waiting to get this done. &gt;:-D</P>
