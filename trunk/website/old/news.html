Mondo and Mindi's new snapshots support ACLs and extended attributes (if your distro
does). That slows down the backup process by 15-20%. This will be reduced to 5-10% in
the development branch (when that opens). Stability is more important than speed.
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
      <I>June 29th, 2004</I></P>
Mondo 2.02 and Mindi 1.02 are out. They are much more supportive of older distros and are
less likely to trigger the kernel/fdisk/ioctl() problem which some LVM users encounter
not just with Mondo but with Linux distro installers such as the ones used by Mandrake
and SuSE.
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
      <I>June 21st, 2004</I></P>
Mondo 2.01 and Mindi 1.01 are out. There were two showstoppers, both affecting Windows users who backup to tape. There were also some spurious error messages and some minor bugs which I took the time to fix.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
It looks as if Partimage 0.6.2 does not support Windows XP (64-bit edition)'s version of NTFS yet. Time will tell. 64-bit users, be warned.
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <I>June 18th, 2004</I></P>
Mondo 2.0 and Mindi 1.0 are out, finally. Enjoy.
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <I>April 19th, 2004</I></P>
Mindi-0.9x used to copy the kernel directly to the 1.44MB boot floppy (if 1.72MB boot/root floppy
was too small to accommodate the kernel and the rootfs). Now it uses LILO. That way, it's more
compatible with modern kernels.
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <I>April 18th, 2004</I></P>
I've added experimental <i>star</i> support and AMD64 support to the development branch. The
new 64-bit distros are Fedora Core 1, Fedora Core 2, SuSE 9.0 and Mandrake 10.0, of which MDK10
and SUS9 are good. By 'good', I mean I've backed up and restored them using the 1.7x/0.9x snapshots. I have not even tried to do that with the FC distros yet.
<P>
I have also added the '-b' command-line switch, to let users specify the internal tape block
size to be used by mondoarchive and mondorestore. Tape streamers should accept a sensible block
size of, say, 32KB which is Mondo's default but some drives just don't want that. This is what
happens when tape streamer vendors do not talk to kernel driver writers. God bless them all.
<P>
Someone told me yesterday that Mondo is the only Open Source DR (Disaster Recovery) solution on
the block. That is either a good thing or a bad thing. It could mean Mondo is a lightning rod
that attracts the best developers and therefore gets the most users, so no-one else bothers
competing. More likely is that Mondo is adequate (not great, just adequate) so the alternatives
(and there must be some) don't get the attention they deserve, simply because most users don't
look very hard for alternatives to adequate solutions.
<P>
Of course, it's possible that Mondo is so inferior that users stick with Closed Source
solutions like Veritas, BRU, Lone Tar and Arkeia. Perhaps only the cash-strapped and the
politically extreme use Mondo. I don't know. I only see the bug reports, which is fine because
that's my job but it does mean I don't get a realistic picture of Mondo's use in the real world.
<P>
On the one hand, now and then, people tell me, 'We love Mondo, it's the best thing we've found
for our purposes, we use it on dozens of PCs, etc.' and then other people tell me, 'It doesn't
run on our hardware, it doesn't like your tape streamers, etc.' It's odd. It's almost as if
- *gasp* - Mondo runs for some users but not others. The trouble is that the 'others' seem
rarely to come to the mailing list with their problems. They prefer to bitch about them. That's
typical of consumers, really. This is why I have some sympathy for Customer Service depts at
companies such as Dell. The good ones try to help but they are usually kicked in the teeth because the customer has already been on the receiving end of bad customer service, often from
someone at the same company as the good CSR.
<P>
It's like dating. You, the new girlfriend, often end up having to pick up the pieces and
clear up the mess left by your date's previous girlfriend. Let's face it, all the best men
are taken and usually by bitches, so your only hope of finding a nice boyfriend is to make
friends with nice, attached guys and wait for their bitchy girlfriends to dump them. At least
then you'll know what you're dealing with.
<P>
But back to software. Does anyone realize how hard it is to run a project like this? The paying
customers do, which is funny because they're the ones who complain the least. It's the non-paying users who tend to do the most complaining and put the least effort into fixing the problems
they encounter, which is a pity because the source code is right there.
<P>
So many people seem oblivious to the fact that I am under no obligation to publish the binaries
on the Internet at all. I could simply sell the CD, remove the source code (and binaries) from
the website, and that would be that. I could leave CVS access there for the hardcore hobbyists.
People don't read the GPL and they don't understand, I do this because I want to, not because
there is a philosophical gun to my head. It's pathetic when people get something for free (including its recipe), don't like its quality, bitch about it <i>and then</i> expect someone
else to do something about it. These are the same people who misread the GPL and complain when
they can't get their snort of Open Source coke for free anymore.
<P>
I don't mind providing the source code. I don't mind publishing it on the Internet (Which I'm under no obligation to do). I don't mind giving free technical support via the mailing list (which, again, I'm under no obligation to do). I do mind when total strangers e-mail me, telling me Mondo sucks, providing me with no technical information, expecting me to solve their problems <i>for free</i>, then getting all butt-hurt when I point out that I'm not a free resource and that my time has value. The website makes it clear: there's a mailing list, there's a web forum, and also there's a PayPal button if you want 1-on-1 technical support from me. Yet, people keep trying it on. Does it hurt to be that stupid? It should.
<P>
Some people will read this rant and think I have a bad attitude. If you think that, consider the possibility that certain members of the Open Source community have been jumping on my last nerve for nearly 5 years. If you have the patience of Job, you're welcome to take my place and see how long that patience lasts. In the meantime, suspend your judgement and consider why I feel the way I feel about the way people behave. If you took your attention away from my attitude ant directed it towards the people who gave it to me, you might not like what you see... but of course, it's much easier to dislike one man's attitude than it is to acknowledge the poor quality of behavior exhibited by a significant proportion of the Open Source community.
<P>
It's human nature. People will try it on, day and night. Men carpet-bomb women with crass invitations in the hope that one woman will accept (and there is usually one who does because of low self-esteem or a sick curiosity). Employers publish advertisements and recruit people at ridiculously low levels of pay for absurdly difficult jobs because that's how the Free Market works. I'm offering X for $Y; there will be someone to buy it. There might be only one person (hence the supply/demand curves and their interaction) but there will always be someone. Even Hitler had a girlfriend, which just goes to show, no matter what kind of person you are, you can find your match. The same is true in Open Source. No matter how crappy your program, someone will (a) use it and (b) write you a long e-mail about how you could improve it. They will also (c) offer no real help for you to achieve [b].

       I'm adding SuSE 8.1 and Fedora Core 2 support at the moment. Watch 
       this space (not literally).</P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <I>March 27th, 2004</I></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       New snapshots are out. Lots of bugs have been fixed. Please try these 
       latest releases and send your feedback to the mailing list or web forum.</P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <I>March 25th, 2004</I></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       I'm back in England to re-sit an exam. In the meantime, I've modified 
       Mondo to backup NTFS partitions under Knoppix. Accordingly, new 
       snapshots (Mondo 1.75_20040329 and Mindi 0.95_20040329) will be 
       releasedon Monday for public consumption. To use them:-</P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       1. Boot from your Knoppix 3.3 LiveCD.<BR>
       2. Open a terminal on the GUI.<BR>
       3. Type:<BR>
       &nbsp; # su -<BR>
       &nbsp; to become root.</P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       4. Insert your Mondo Install CD in your other CD-ROM/DVD drive or 
       mount it across your network.<BR>
       5. Mount it. If you are mounting another CD drive, it will be 
       something like this:<BR>
       &nbsp; # mkdir /mnt/auxcd<BR>
       &nbsp; # mount /dev/hdd /mnt/auxcd -t iso9660 -o ro<BR>
       &nbsp; # /mnt/auxcd/setup</P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       &nbsp; In my case, I have the original filesystem on my network, so I 
       do this:<BR>
       &nbsp; # mkdir /mnt/mondostuff<BR>
       &nbsp; # netcardconfig ...to setup the network<BR>
       &nbsp; # mount 192.168.0.33:/home/mondostuff /mnt/mondostuff -t nfs<BR>
       &nbsp; # /mnt/mondostuff/MondoCD/setup</P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       6. When asked whether you want (S)table or (D)evelopment, type D &lt;Enter&gt;.<BR>
       7. When the 'setup' script terminates, type:<BR>
       &nbsp; # export PATH=/ramdisk/usr/bin:/ramdisk/usr/sbin:$PATH<BR>
       &nbsp; # mkdir -p /ramdisk/foo<BR>
       &nbsp; # echo hi &gt; /ramdisk/foo/bar.txt<BR>
       &nbsp; # mondoarchive -OVt -d /dev/st0 -gF -I /ramdisk/foo -x 
       /dev/hda1 -W<BR>
       &nbsp; (Something like that, anyway.)</P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       The mondoarchive command is a typical call to mondoarchive execpt for:<BR>
       a) the dummy loading of regular files, thanks to /ramdisk/foo<BR>
       b) the fact that it backs up my NFS partition (-x /dev/hda1)<BR>
       c) the fact that the archives are NOT bootable (-W)</P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       I've backed up /dev/hda1 (NTFS partition), wiped it w/ dd if=zero 
       of=/dev/hda1 ..., restored from backups, and booted back into Windows 
       2000. It appears Mondo now backs up and restores NTFS partitions 
       while running on a Knoppix LiveCD.</P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       Users are welcome to report their experiences, problems, etc. to the 
       mailing list.</P>

       Happy New Year. My wife and I are (a) expecting a baby and (b) 
       emigrating to California soon. I am doing full-time contract work for 
       an Internet start-up in Martlesham, Suffolk. Kate still isn't allowed 
       to work and my US visa still isn't here. Gotta love Immigration. Oh, 
       and there's a new(ish) article on Mondo - <A HREF="http://www.linux-tip.net/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=71">click

       I've updated Mindi 0.9x's busybox from 0.60.5 to 1.0.0pre3 and its 
       uClibc from 0.9.19 to 0.9.23, in preparation for adding kernel 2.6.x 
       support to the development branch. NTFS support in Mondo 1.7x is 
       finally fixed for good. It took six months but I think it will be 
       worth the effort.</P>

       Mondo v1.67 and Mindi v0.87 were released a few days ago without any 
       fanfare at all. :) On the whole, the response has been positive. A 
       few bugs still exist (don't they always?). They are listed on the <A HREF="../support/support.html#knownbugs">Known
        bugs</A> section of the Support page. We're working on them when we

       I am now in full-time employment again, my dissertation is due in a

       Mondo 1.7x (the development branch) now differs from Mondo 1.6x in 
       the following ways:-</P>
      <UL>
       <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
       <P>
        It supports native DVD (re)writing<BR>
        <LI CLASS="mvd-P">It supports OnStream tape drives<BR>
        <LI CLASS="mvd-P">It has proper NTFS support<BR>
        <LI CLASS="mvd-P">It catalogues your filesystem 20-30% faster than 
        Mondo 1.6x does, with a pretty UI to boot<BR>
        <LI CLASS="mvd-P">Its GUI detects your NFS partitions and excludes 
        them by default<BR>
        <LI CLASS="mvd-P">Its GUI detects your Windows (NTFS) partitions and 
        'partimages' them by default<BR>
        <LI CLASS="mvd-P">It supports text-only restore, which is handy for 
        SuSE users and others w/ broken Newt libraries<BR>
        <LI CLASS="mvd-P">It lets you specify your own filelist via the -J switch<BR>
        <LI CLASS="mvd-P">It lets you ask for the CD-ROM drive never to 
        eject, which is handy if your computer case would break in the event 
        of an unexpected ejection (WTF is wrong with PC designers these days?)<BR>
        <LI CLASS="mvd-P">The code is much cleaner and has better inline documentation</P>
       </UL>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       You're welcome to try it (in conjunction with Mindi 0.9x) but please 
       remember, it is beta-quality code. If it eats your data, you are on 
       your own. Still, I've finally fixed Mondo 1.7x's NTFS support. I 
       zeroed out the destination hard disk &amp; then nuke-restored my main 
       development box onto it. I was able to boot into Windows 2000, watch 
       DVD movies, chat on the Net, etc. Everything was there, right down to 
       the orange roof on Howard Johnson's outhouse. This is great.</P>

       Debian 3.0's 2.4.18 stock kernel (available on CD#5) appears to 
       support Mondo. That's right, folks: Debian and Mondo play nicely. I 
       don't know who made it so but I'm glad they did.</P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       Mondo also works with Trustix 2.0 and SME 5.6 now. The new packages 
       are on the Download page.</P>

       Mondo v1.7x has multi-tape support again. I'm quite excited about 
       this because Mondo v1.7x now supports OnStream ADR and ADR-2 drives, 
       which were always tricky in the past. The GUI is a little nicer too. 
       It's all coming together, thanks to the hard work of all members of 
       the devteam. Oh, and NTFS support is now better than ever, thanks to partimagehack-static.</P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <I>September 16th</I></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       Mondo v1.7x now uses partimagehack-static (a bastardized partimage, 
       available from Mondo's Download page) to backup and restore NTFS 
       partitions without backing up the unused sectors. I have also 
       rewritten mondo-makefilelist as a C subroutine, which shaves 30s or 
       so off mondoarchive's execution runtime. The -D (differential) flag 
       no longer supports multi-level differentials. If you want it badly 
       enough, you'll write a patch, right? :)</P>

      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       NTFS support still isn't quite right in 1.7x, although it is fine in 
       1.6x; will I have 1.7x ready by December? Time will tell. I've 
       rewritten 1.7x's tape buffer code and it seems to work fine with ADR 
       and ADR-2 drives, which were always problematic until now.</P>

       streamer this weekend.</P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       I've recently added Partimagehack support to Mondo. Partimagehack is 
       just partimage with a few hacks by yours truly, so that Windows users 
       may backup NTFS partitions with Mondo without backing up the unused 
       sectors as well. Partimagehack is available for download from the 
       obvioius place (yes, the Download page), as is the Mondo 1.7x branch 
       and its corresponding Mind 0.9x branch.</P>
