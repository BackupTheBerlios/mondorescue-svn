		<h1>About Mondo Rescue</h1>
  <div class="h2-1">
    <h2>What is Mondo Rescue ?</h2>
  </div>
       <B>Mondo is reliable.</B> It backs up your GNU/Linux server or 
       workstation to tape, CD-R, CD-RW, NFS or hard disk partition. In the 
       event of catastrophic data loss, you will be able to restore all of 
       your data [or as much as you want], from bare metal if necessary. 
       Mondo is in use by Lockheed-Martin, Nortel Networks, Siemens, HP (US 
       and France), IBM, NASA's JPL, the US Dept of Agriculture, dozens of 
       smaller companies, and tens of thousands of users.</P>
       <B>Mondo is comprehensive.</B> Mondo supports LVM, RAID, ext2, ext3, 
       JFS, XFS, ReiserFS, VFAT, and can support additional filesystems 
       easily: just e-mail the <A HREF="/feedback.html">mailing list</A> 
       with your request. It supports adjustments in disk geometry, 
       including migration from non-RAID to RAID. Mondo runs on all major 
       Linux distributions and is getting better all the time. You may even 
       use it to backup non-Linux partitions, such as NTFS.</P>
       <B>Mondo is free!</B> It has been published under the GPL (GNU Public 
       License), partly to expose it to thousands of potential beta-testers 
       but mostly as a contribution to the Linux community. I charge for 
       1-to-1 technical support to fund Mondo's development.</P>

       There are dozens of regular contributors and over 300 members of the 
       mailing list. The user base is estimated at between 50,000 and 
       100,000. Mondo has a vibrant, active, rambunctious user and developer community.</P>
      <P>
       When I first created Mondo, I did so because there was nothing like 
       it available to me (not for a reasonable price, at least). Nowadays, 
       Mondo is not the only good, free disaster recovery solution for 
       Linux. You may wish to try <A HREF="http://mkcdrec.ota.be"><B>mkcdrec</B></A>.
        The software has been in existence for almost as long as Mondo, it 
       supports the same filesystems (including RAID and LVM), and its 
       author is friendly and helpful.</P>
      <P>
       Final thoughts</P>
       &quot;Mondo is aimed at skilled users, not the 3l33T3 war3z crowd.
