  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   Mondo Rescue backs up your file system to CD, tape, NFS (archives 
   stored remotely) or ISO's (archives stored locally). Mondo uses afio 
   as the backup engine; afio is a well-respected replacement for tar. 
   In the event of catastrophic data loss, you may restore some or all 
   of your system, even if your hard drives are now blank. Mondo Rescue 
   can do a lot of other cool things:</P>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P ALIGN=LEFT>
    You can use Mondo to clone an installation of Linux. Just backup the 
    crucial stuff and exclude /home, /var/log, etc.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P ALIGN=LEFT>
    You can backup a non-RAID file system and restore it as RAID 
    including the root partition (if your kernel supports that).</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P ALIGN=LEFT>
    You can backup a system running on one format and restore as another format.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P ALIGN=LEFT>
    You can restructure your partitions, e.g. shrink/enlarge, reassign 
    devices, add hard drives, etc, before you partition and format your 
    drives. Mondo will restore your data and amend /etc/lilo.conf and 
    /etc/fstab accordingly.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P ALIGN=LEFT>
    You can backup Linux/Windows systems, including the boot sectors. 
    Mondo will make everything right at restore-time. (However, do run 
    &quot;Scandisk&quot; when you first boot into Windows, just in case.)</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P ALIGN=LEFT>
    You can use your Mondo backup CD to verify the integrity of your computer.</P>
   </UL>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   Mondo's principal virtue is that it protects you from the problems 
   that can arise when you reinstall completely from scratch. If you 
   want to wipe and restore your system every year just as a matter of 
   'good practice', Mondo is not for you. However, if you want to get up 
   and running again in a hurry after someone breaks into your computer 
   and wipes it (or if you accidentally wipe it yourself) then Mondo is 
   definitely for you. It will permit you to roll back to a known-good 
   installation in a very short period of time, sometimes as little as 
   twenty minutes. Even if you backup large amounts of data to tape 
   daily and do not want to add yet another backup regime, please 
   consider backing up the core filesystem (i.e. everything but the 
   directories containing your huge database and your prizewinning 
   novel) every month or so, just in case. You will be glad you did.</P>

   <B>What is Mondo not?</B></P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   Mondo is not an everyday backup program. It is not designed to 
   replace tar, afio, kbackup, etc. Mondo is designed to make it 
   possible to recover from scratch if necessary. Tar and afio offer a 
   quick, convenient way to backup small sets of files, sometimes to 
   removable media.</P>
