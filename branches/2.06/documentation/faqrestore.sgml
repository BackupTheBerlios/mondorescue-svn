<para><anchor id="AEN822"/>Q: Can Mondo help me
move/resize/re-allocate my partitions?</para>
<para>A: Yes. Just backup your system in Interactive Mode using
Mondo. Edit the mountlist when prompted.</para>
<para><anchor id="AEN827"/>Q: My zip drive is a SCSI drive. When I
restore, Mondo craps out, saying it can't mount the drive (because
there is no disk in it). What do I do?</para>
<para>A: Restore in Interactive Mode. Delete the SCSI drive from
the mountlist before you restore. Then Mondo won't try to partition
or format it. Next time you backup, use -E /dev/sdd (or whatever
your zip drive is). The /dev entry will be excluded from the
mountlist but not from the filelist. So, when you restore, you
won't accidentally reformat your zip disk. However, after
restoring, you will find that /dev/sdd (the _file_) will still be
present in your /dev directory. Cool, eh?</para>
<para><anchor id="AEN832"/>Q: I received a message like, 'Fileset
NNN failed' during restore. What does it mean.</para>
<para>A: It usually means either you had a very large (&gt;2GB)
file which was not archived owing to a flaw in your distro or your
filesystem has changed in relation to the backup.</para>
<para><anchor id="AEN837"/>Q: Why does my ext3 partition have less
space free than when I backed it up?</para>
<para>A: Mondo creates a 10MB journal file area. Your journal was
probably smaller than that, hence the difference.</para>

<varlistentry><term><para id="SEGF"></para>Q: When I restore after
booting from the CD/floppies, I sometimes get errors like, "Running
out of memory" or "Segmentation fault". What is going on?</term>
<varlistentry><term>A: It sounds as if you are running out of disk
space, probably ram disk space. Type 'df -m' to see which
partitions are running low on space. Please send as much
information as you can to the mailing list. This problem is
believed to have been fixed in 1.63 and 1.71.</term>

<para><anchor id="LVM"/>Q: I can't nuke-restore my LVM or RAID or
LVM-on-RAID setup. I have to do it manually. What now?</para>
<para>A: You said it yourself. You have to do it manually. :) Sorry
but that's about it. At least you have all the tools to do it. I
assume you know how. If you don't, look at i-want-my-lvm (a script
on the ramdisk) if you're using LVM. It should give you a few
clues. RAID is harder but in general Mondo's RAID support is good.
After you've prepped and formatted your drives, run mondorestore
again but say 'no' when asked if you want Mondo to prep or format
your drives.</para>
