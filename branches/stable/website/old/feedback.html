        &quot;I'd just like to thank you for creating Mondo. It is the most 
        full-featured and stable recovery/cloning system I have ever had the 
        pleasure to use. I have started implementing it across our 
        organization with very good results.&quot; - D.V.</P>

        &quot;Thanks for a great piece of code, for the quick response to 
        questions, for not tolerating incompetence. [...] I've asked 6 
        questions in 6 days, and gotton reasonable answers to all of them. As 
        a sysadmin ( and previously mainframe systems programmer) for 25 
        years, I know how tempting it is to answer with 'Sure! and I'll just 
        stop at the Men's and pick up a roll,, so I can wipe your BUTT 
        too!'... And you mostly manage to avoid that. I haven't seen any 
        other OpenSource project, that responds to questions (paid or not) in 
        less then 48 hours. And when I wasn't paying I got responses too! And 
        it's very much appreciated.&quot; - J.R.</P>

        &quot;A few days ago, I did a backup [with Mondo]. Well, disaster 
        struck yesterday. A hard disk went bad. Well, this morning, I bought 
        a new hard disk and popped in the first of my 7 backup CD's. It all 
        went great! I'm back, with nothing lost. I'd like to shake your hand

        &quot;Went to my machine last evening to check my e-mail and was 
        greeted [by a] long string of messages about not being able to 
        read/write inodes. A reboot resulted in some horrible sounds from my 
        hard drive... Fortunately, I run Mondo once a week! [After] a quick 
        trip to buy a new hard drive, [I'm] back up and running... This is a 
        great system.&quot; - E.S.</P>

        &quot;It's been said before but I'll say it again: Mondo is great! 
        The ability to backup to an NFS-mounted drive, to run custom 
        post-archive commands, and the flexible restore options allowed me to 
        configure Mondo perfectly for my custom setup... Mondo's flexibility 
        makes me feel prepared to deal with any disaster. My data has never 
        been so safe!&quot; - Anon.</P>

        &quot;Due to an apparent bug in [my Linux distribution's sysadm 
        tool], my base system directories were overwritten, <I>twice!</I> 
        Fortunately, I had just made (and tested) mondo backups just a few 
        days before. Mondorestore worked just great. It restored everything 
        just as it was...&quot; - K.A..</P>

        &quot;I had terrific success on a Red Hat 7.3 install on my home box 
        &amp; similar results on 2 mailservers running Red Hat 7.1 at the

        &quot;We were looking at writing/developing our own backup solution. 
        But your product enables even our most computer illiterate staff to 
        quickly rescue a server. Our test benchmark restored our test server 
        from a partition wipe in 7m36s! We are glad that you have released a

        &quot;I would like to thank you for developing such a great backup 
        program. A couple of months ago, I stumbled across mondo on 
        freshmeat, tried it out and discovered the CD burning feature of the 
        tool. I immediately bought myself a set of CD-RWs and ran a backup. I 
        didn't touch the program for a couple of months and one day, I 
        started using my PC only to discover that ... all of my valuable data 
        was gone and corrupted beyond recovering.</P>
       <P>
        &quot;I was in despair for a couple of days realizing that I had lost 
        everything from software that I had been working on to digital 
        pictures of my family and friends. I finally remembered that I had 
        made those backups. I booted up a restore and ... it worked like a 
        charm! My system was back to the way I had it along with most of my 
        software and pictures! So, basically I thought that I'd give you this 
        little anecdote to show you that your hard work had saved my butt. 
        Keep up the good work!&quot; - C.M.</P>

        not exactly a glowing testimonial but to my knowledge it was the 
        first time Mondo was mentioned in a major Linux publication... but 
        not the last. December 2001's Linux Journal had a 4-page spread on Mondo.</TD>
