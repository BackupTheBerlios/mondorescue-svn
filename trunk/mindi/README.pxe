README for mondo/mindi usage with PXE

mondorescue now supports the possibility to deploy mondo-images using the Pre eXecution Environment (PXE) standard.
As this README only focusses on the mondorescue part, please read how to do Linux deployments with pxelinux on http://syslinux.zytor.com/pxe.php

To use it, please do the following on your deployment server:

Add the following line to your default file:
mondo
        kernel vmlinuz-mondo
        initrd initrd-mondo pxe ...

Thus the PXE ROM will boot mondo's kernel and mondo's initrd in memory and will append all the right configuration options (as you find in syslinux.cfg on the mindi's floppy image) to which you need to add the keyword pxe.
(You need to have backup your data using the NFS option of mondoarchive)

During boot mondorestore will start your NFS configuration and mount mondo's content from the network rather than from a physical media.

Please report any problem around that tool to bruno.cornec@hp.com
