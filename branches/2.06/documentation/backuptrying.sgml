<para>Mama does Mondo? Papa does Mondo? Is that a Dean Martin song?
Well, anyway, here is how I backup my system:</para>

<para>For most users, that should be enough. :-) Mondoarchive will
usually autodetect your hardware and configure it for you.</para>
<para>If you are a power user (or you like to control every detail
of how Mondo runs) then you may want to look at the command-line
switches. For example:-</para>

<para>Cdrecord will tell me where my CD recorder lives, in SCSI
terms, which in my case is '0,0,0'. The call to mondoarchive tells
Mondo that I want to backup everything to a 4x CD-RW drive that has
a CD-RW disk in it. (Use -Oc instead of -Ow if you are using
CD-R.)</para>
<para>Please put the first CD-R(W) in the drive now. You will be
prompted to insert CD #2 but you will not be prompted to insert the
first disk. However, if you forget, do not worry: if Mondo fails to
write the first (or any) disk, it will offer to retry, abort or
fail.</para>
<para>I run Mondo at the highest compression available ('-9) and
then go to work. I then walk home at lunch (I live right by my
workplace), change CD, eat lunch, and go back to work. When I get
home, it has all been done.</para>
<para>Your mileage may vary. Experiment. Find the speed/compression
compromise that best suits your needs.</para>
<para>If you are using cron then please use -F to make sure that
Mondo does not prompt you to create bootable floppy disks. Cron
does not handle user interaction well because it pipes stdin and
stdout specially. Please consult cron's manual for more
information. Jesse Keating has written a script for cron/Mondo
users. It is available on the
<ulink url="../../docs/docs.html">Documentation</ulink>
page.</para>
