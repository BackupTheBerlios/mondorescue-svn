<sect1 id="RESTOREOVERVIE"><title>9.1. Overview</title>
<para>I hope you don't have to restore from scratch very often.
It's nerve-wracking until you realize that Mondo's restore engine
is very reliable. I backup and restore my system 2 or 3 times a
week as part of the testing process. I have no other backup regime,
so it had better work.</para>
<para>If you find that you cannot make your PC boot from the CD,
take heart: the first backup CD of each set contains floppy disk
images to give you the same functionality as the CD (minus the
archives, of course) on floppies. Remember, your Mondo CD is a
fully functional CD-based mini-distribution as well as a recovery
CD.</para>

<para>If the CD is not found during the initial restore CD boot
attempt, reboot the PC a second time prior to reporting failure.
Occasional timing errors and hardware/software/system conflicts do
occur.</para>
