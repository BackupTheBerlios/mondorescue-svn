<sect1 id="MONDORESCU"><title>3.1. Mondo Rescue</title>
<para>Mondo Rescue backs up your file system to CD, tape, NFS
(archives stored remotely) or ISO's (archives stored locally).
Mondo uses afio as the backup engine; afio is a well-respected
replacement for tar. In the event of catastrophic data loss, you
may restore some or all of your system, even if your hard drives
are now blank. Mondo Rescue can do a lot of other cool
things:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>You can use Mondo to clone an installation of Linux. Just
backup the crucial stuff and exclude /home, /var/log, etc.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>You can backup a non-RAID file system and restore it as RAID
including the root partition (if your kernel supports that).</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>You can backup a system running on one format and restore as
another format.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>You can restructure your partitions, e.g. shrink/enlarge,
reassign devices, add hard drives, etc, before you partition and
format your drives. Mondo will restore your data and amend
/etc/lilo.conf and /etc/fstab accordingly.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>You can backup Linux/Windows systems, including the boot
sectors. Mondo will make everything right at restore-time.
(However, do run "Scandisk" when you first boot into Windows, just
in case.)</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>You can use your Mondo backup CD to verify the integrity of
your computer.</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>Mondo's principal virtue is that it protects you from the
problems that can arise when you reinstall completely from scratch.
If you want to wipe and restore your system every year just as a
matter of 'good practice', Mondo is not for you. However, if you
want to get up and running again in a hurry after someone breaks
into your computer and wipes it (or if you accidentally wipe it
yourself) then Mondo is definitely for you. It will permit you to
roll back to a known-good installation in a very short period of
time, sometimes as little as twenty minutes. Even if you backup
large amounts of data to tape daily and do not want to add yet
another backup regime, please consider backing up the core
filesystem (i.e. everything but the directories containing your
huge database and your prizewinning novel) every month or so, just
in case. You will be glad you did.</para>
<para>What is Mondo not?</para>
<para>Mondo is not an everyday backup program. It is not designed
to replace tar, afio, kbackup, etc. Mondo is designed to make it
possible to recover from scratch if necessary. Tar and afio offer a
quick, convenient way to backup small sets of files, sometimes to
removable media.</para>
