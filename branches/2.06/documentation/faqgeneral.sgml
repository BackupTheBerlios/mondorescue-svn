</variablelist>
<para><anchor id="AEN496"/>Q: What is "Mindi"?</para>
<para>A: Mindi, a.k.a. Mindi-Linux, makes a mini-distribution from
your kernel, modules, modules, tools and libraries. It can also
generate an El Torito 2.88MB boot disk image. Mondo uses Mindi to
create a mini-distro, then boots from it and runs on it.</para>
<para><anchor id="AEN501"/>Q: Why is it called "Mondo"?</para>
<para>A: The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles described cool things as
'mondo'. I wasn't sure what to call this project. 'Faust' was one
idea I had, partly as a dig at my former boss who practically owned
me because of my legal status at the time. In the end, I chose
something short and distinctive.</para>
<para><anchor id="AEN506"/>Q: Mondo does not work on my system. It
keels over and dies. What's wrong?</para>
<para>A: It works on Red Hat 7.x, Linux-Mandrake 8.x, some flavors
of SuSE, some flavors of Slackware, some flavors of Debian, etc.
The more distributions I support, the more moving targets I have to
hit. Please bear this in mind when e-mailing the list. :) If you
would like to help me by beta-testing Mondo (or Mindi) on your PC
then I would be very interested in working with you to work around
the eccentricities of your Linux distro. However, rest assured, 90%
of the bugs reported to me are actually symptoms of FooLinux X.Y's
unique way of doing things.</para>
<para><anchor id="AEN511"/>Q: What if the error is in Mindi?</para>
<para>A: Then send me a copy of /var/log/mindi.log (compressed,
please) along with a description of your distro, your kernel, etc.
Oh, and before sending it, please read it.</para>
<para><anchor id="AEN516"/>Q: Can I trust Mondo?</para>
<para>A: Mondo has generated reliable archives since May 2000. I
have lost data by using bad CD-R disks and not verifying their
contents. Some users have not tried booting from their CD until
crunch time. Remember to boot into Compare Mode to verify the
backup before you trust it. If Mondo did not work, you would not be
reading this. If it does not work for you, your kernel is usually
the culprit. Check <ulink url="kernelsupport.html">Linux Kernel
support</ulink> to see what your kernel should support. Please
e-mail the list (or me) if you need some help with this.</para>
<para><anchor id="AEN522"/>Q: How do I report a bug?</para>
<para>A: E-mail the bug report (mondo.err.xxxxx.tgz) to me. If you
want to discuss it, please e-mail the list. The list is for
talking; my e-mail address is for big files. :-) If you don't send
me a logfile then there isn't a lot that I can do for you, so
PLEASE include a logfile at the very least. Or, pop into #mondo on
irc.redhat.com and see if I'm there.</para>
<para><anchor id="AEN527"/>Q: I think Mondo should (...insert
suggestion here...) and I have rewritten it accordingly. Would you
like to see my patch?</para>
<para>A: Absolutely! :-) The best way for you to make Mondo do what
you want is to modify it and then send me the patch. That way, we
can all benefit.</para>
<para><anchor id="AEN532"/>Q: I think Mondo should (...insert
suggestion here...); will you incorporate this feature for me,
please?</para>
<para>A: I'll definitely think about it. Would you like to
help?</para>
<para><anchor id="AEN537"/>Q: Mondo says, "XXX is missing," and
then terminates. What's wrong?</para>
<para>A: A good Linux distribution should contain XXX but the
designers, in their infinite wisdom, decided not to include that
particular tool. Check <ulink url="linuxpackages.html">Related
Linux Packages</ulink> and install the missing package. If that
fails, contact the vendor/distributor/manufacturer/designer of your
distro.</para>
<para><anchor id="AEN543"/>Q: Can Mondo handle multi-CD backups and
restores?</para>
<para>A: Yes, up to twenty CD per set. This 20-CD limit results
from laziness on my part. I can remove it at any time. However, if
your system occupies more than 20 CD, may I recommend that you
invest in a tape streamer?</para>
<para><anchor id="AEN548"/>Q: Can Mondo handle Linux/Windows
dual-boot systems?</para>
<para>A: Yes. If your system currently boots into Linux or Windows
via LILO, you can backup and restore both OSes at the same time
using Mondo. If you are using NTFS then add the switch, '-x
&lt;device&gt;'.</para>
<para><anchor id="AEN553"/>Q: Can Mondo backup Windows-only
systems?</para>
<para>A: Sure, if you pay me to play catch-up to Microsoft. ;)
Seriously, Mondo can do it but I do not give away the
functionality. If you are a Microsoft-only user, you are accusomed
to paying for software and technical support. Please e-mail me for
more information.</para>
<para><anchor id="AEN558"/>Q: Does Mondo support LVM?</para>
<para>A: Mondo supports LVM, yes. Mondo backs up and restores your
existing setup but it does not make it easy for you to change your
LVM configuration. You have to edit /tmp/i-want-my-lvm at boot-time
to do that.</para>
<para><anchor id="AEN563"/>Q: What if I don't use LILO? What if I
use GRUB?</para>
<para>A: GRUB is supported by Mondo.</para>
<para><anchor id="AEN568"/>Q: Mondoarchive (or mondorestore)
segfaults when I run it. What could be wrong?</para>
<para>A: Install from tarball instead of RPM. (Or, try RPM if you
just installed from tarball.) Your compiler or your libraries may
be fubar. We'll see. If that doesn't work then please e-mail the
<ulink url="../../feedback/feedback.html">mailing
list</ulink>.</para>
<para><anchor id="AEN573"/>Q: I get the error, 'Cannot find
/tmp/dev.0' or 'Cannot mount device 0x0701'; what do I do?</para>
<para>A: Please free up /dev/loop0 using 'losetup /dev/loop0 -d' to
unmount that loop device. If your OS will not let you do that,
contact your local support group or Linux vendor.</para>
<para><anchor id="AEN578"/>Q: Can I create a Mondo CD and then use
it to create an archive of any OS on any PC?</para>
<para>A: Not yet. You can use Mondo to backup Linux or
Linux/Windows dual boot. One day, Mondo will let you backup
partitions it can't read or write, by treating each partition as
one long file to be backed up. This file will be chopped,
compressed and archived like any other big file.</para>
<para><anchor id="AEN583"/>Q: Why do you insist on putting floppy
disk images on Mondo CD? They waste space and I never use them. The
CD works just fine, so why keep the floppy disk images?</para>
<para>A: Because of my old college buddy, Justin Case. If you
really, truly want them gone then please submit a patch to make
them optional.</para>
<para><anchor id="AEN588"/>Q: Why doesn't the Mondo project have a
cool-looking animal logo?</para>
<para>A: Excellent question! Please submit graphics of candidate
animal logos!</para>
<para><anchor id="AEN593"/>Q: Is there a Mondo user 'Code of
Conduct?</para>
<para>A: Yes. Read the HOWTO. Submit patches. Recommend realistic
improvements. Be courteous to other users on the discussion list.
Do not whine.</para>
