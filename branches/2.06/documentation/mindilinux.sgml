<sect1 id="MINDILINU"><title>3.2. Mindi Linux</title>
<para>Mindi Linux creates a set of boot/root floppy disk images
that will let you perform basic system maintenance on your Linux
distro. The principal virtues of Mindi's boot disks are the fact
that they contain your kernel, modules, tools and libraries. You
can ask for additional binaries (or other files) to be included on
the kit. The libraries will be added for you.</para>
<para>Whichever modules were loaded at backup-time, they are
reloaded at boot-time. So, in theory, you will boot into almost the
same environment as you were in when you backed up. If you want to
add files to your Mindi boot disks, edit '&lt;INSTALLPATH OF
MINDI&gt;/mindi/deplist.txt' and add the files to that list. The
added files and dependencies, will be spread across the data disks
at run-time.</para>
<para>Mindi makes sure that Mondo has all the tools it needs at
boot-time. Mondo uses fdisk, mkfs, cat, less, more, afio, gzip,
bzip2, your keyboard configuration, your glibc libraries, your
other libraries, your kernel, your modules, ... a lot! Mindi takes
care of all that, so that Mondo can get on with the job of backing
up or restoring your data.</para>
<para>Mindi is also handy for making boot CDs/disks which stand on
their own. You do not need Mondo. Indeed, if you like, you could
use another backup/restore program with Mindi. Just add it to
Mindi's dependency list (type 'locate deplist.txt' to find it).
Mindi will include your software on its boot CD/disks the next time
you run mindi.</para>
