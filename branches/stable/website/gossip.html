<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
[09/23] New stable and unstable snapshots are out. Mondo v1.5x now 
lets you exclude all NFS-related mounts and devices, with the '-N' 
switch. Also, major DevFS-related bugs have been fixed which affect 
NTFS users in particular.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
[09/06] Mondo v1.46 and Mindi v0.66 are out. I am keeping the dates 
in the version numbers (i.e. 1.46_20020906 and 0.66_20020906) for 
various reasons. If people don't like it, people will let me know, I

many changes under the hood, none of which are very interesting to 
the expert user but all of which will benefit the novice user. For 
example, just type 'mondoarchive' to backup your PC. Type 
'mondorestore' to restore with or without rebooting first. It's that

The new stable (1.4x, 0.6x) snapshots will make it easier for tape 
users to spread their data across tapes without worrying about 
exactly how large the tapes are. Some tapes are not actually as large 
as they say they are, so Mondo will from now on leave 100MB unused at 
the end of each tape. Of course, if your tape is 20MB less than it 
claims to be in length then you'll only lose 80MB... ;-)</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
The development (1.5x, 0.7x) snapshots will detect your tape/CD drive 
and its settings for you if you run 'mondoarchive' (i.e. without any parameters).</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
On a more serious note, let's remember that the War on Terrorism is 
about <A HREF="http://www.alternet.org/story.html?StoryID=12205">oil, 
not freedom</A>. How about a war on <A HREF="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/2183748.stm">pedophilia</A>?
Oh, I forgot, protecting children from sexual abuse isn't as sexy as 
saving the world from this week's evil archvillain. How about a war 
on soft money? Well, Enron can't <A HREF="http://www.public-i.org/story_01_010902.htm">bribe
him</A> a second time: they're broke. How about a war on corporate 
accounting skullduggery? Cheney's relationship with Arthur Andersen 
would make that difficult. Oh well. The Bush Administration is well 
known for its irrational exuberance (or should that be hubris?).</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Never mind that the President was <A HREF="http://www.public-i.org/story_01_100400.htm">judged</A> 
by the SEC to have engaged in Martha Stewart's new, fun pastime. (I 
can imagine the headline-writers now: &quot;What? Martha's been 
defrauding us? Hold the front page and drop that silly lead banner 
about Dubya. The People have a right to know the truth about Martha, 
and we're gonna tell 'em!&quot;)</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Oh, that's right, it was ten years ago. Presidents only have to 
behave honorably after they've been elected. They can pardon 
themselves, especially if they're Christians, and just go on as if 
nothing had ever happened. The People don't need to know every detail 
of Dubya's sordid past, do they?</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
How about his sordid present?</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Let's look at both by going back to the 'evil archvillain' thing. 
Bush's family has been <A HREF="http://www.rense.com/general14/bushsformer.htm">doing
business</A> with evil archenemies since WW2, when the family 
company was seized by the US Government on the grounds that it was a 
front for the Nazis. Now, fast-forward to the 1990's. Bush Jr. has 
inherited a propensity for collecting <A HREF="http://www.globalresearch.ca/articles/INL110A.html">buddies
of ill repute</A> such as Khaled bin Mahfouz.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Khaled bin Mahfouz is a big investor in the Carlyle Group (GOP pals 
and military hardware manufacturers who've done rather nicely out of 
this latest 'war') with chums on the Group's board. He is also <A HREF="http://www.ardmoreite.com/stories/102999/new_saudi.shtml">backing
Bin Laden</A> to the tune of 7 figures a year, and has been for a decade.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Did I mention Enron had been secretly negotiating with the Taliban to 
build a pipeline through Afghanistan? Did you know that? Neither did 
I. The <A HREF="http://www.john-loftus.com/enron3.htm">cover-up by 
the FBI</A> was a little <I>too </I>successful: it gave the Taliban 
time to let Al Qaida complete the training and preparation necessary 
for the attack on the World Trade Center - you know, the one in mid-September
of last year. Oh, and Bush Sr. was a business partner in the Carlyle 
Group with the Bin Laden family from the early Nineties to... hmm, 
you'll have to fill in the end-date for yourselves.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
That pipeline 'operation' was the reason Enron (a <A HREF="http://www.moles.org/ProjectUnderground/drillbits/5_10/vs.html">seasoned
malefactor</A> in the oil business) bought up huge tracts of land in 
the Caspian basin: it was for the <A HREF="http://www.fairfieldweekly.com/articles/enron.html">'railroad
about to go through Rock Ridge</A>'. What a good thing that Bush now 
has ersatz control of Afghanistan and its government. All he needs 
now is a toe-hold in Turkmenistan. With Enron stock at an all-time 
low, its land almost worthless and&nbsp;the Afghani <I>and</I> 
Turkmeni governments nice and pliable (the latter terrified of <A HREF="http://www.rferl.org/nca/features/2000/04/F.RU.000425131548.html">Russia</A> 
trying to assert itself), Bush's business associates can build the 
pipeline oh-so-cheaply. They'll make a killing, just like <A HREF="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/12/02/BU172807.DTL">the
Carlyle Group are</A>.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
The sooner the American government (whoever happens to be at the helm 
- Dick Cheney, Mrs Clinton, Dick Cheney again, ...) stops taking it 
upon itself to engage in unilateral military incursions (200+ since 
1945, with 680 million dead) to score points at home, the sooner the 
World will stop laughing at America.</P>

v0.56 is out. It fixes minor keyboard mapping bugs. Mondo v1.25 is 
out, too. It handles files of 2GB in size now. There are a few other 
minor fixes but basically v1.2x is solid as a rock, as far as I can 
tell. Please feel free to send me bug reports to prove me wrong. ;)</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

submit logs with bug reports. :)</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

v1.36 and Mindi v0.53 are out. Mondo v1.36 is a giant leap forward 
but it's not for newbies. Use it with caution. If you are reading 
this, it means I have successfully nuked my PC with v1.36; however, 
YMMV. Tape users should always use --verify. CD users should not use 
--verify but should boot into Compare Mode instead.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

v1.23 is due out on Sunday. It will install in /usr/local. Ditto, 
Mindi v0.52. Mondo v1.35 has been pushed back by at least a week. It 
might be out on Jan 15th. Rewriting the tape support from the ground 
up is turning out to be harder than I thought. I have spent about 40 
hours on it since last Saturday. I am still burning the midnight oil, 
testing it, breaking it, fixing it...</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
