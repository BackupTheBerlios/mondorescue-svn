<para>This HOWTO is incomplete but accurate to the best of my
knowledge. Please provide suggestions and recommendations for
improving this document in a separate e-mail to the mailing list.
Join the mailing list at
<ulink url="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/mondo-devel">http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/mondo-devel</ulink>;
e-mail the list at
<ulink url="mailto:mondo-devel@lists.sourceforge.net">mondo-devel@lists.sourceforge.net</ulink>;
tell us what is wrong and how it should be fixed. Include the
section title and recommended changes. Whenever possible, include
the exact, spell-checked, grammar-checked text that you think would
improve the document.</para>
<para>See Mondo's
<ulink url="../../feedback/feedback.html">Feedback</ulink> page for
more information.</para>
<para>Please note that we do our best to help everyone but it is
difficult for us to help you if you do not attach a log file to
your e-mail. Let me say that again - attach your log file to your
e-mail! Thank you. Without it, we can only wave our hands and say,
"Well, it could be this or it could be that," and we can't offer
any tangible help because you aren't either. That's what the log
file is for. It is located at /var/log/mondo-archive.log; please
use gzip to compress it before attaching it, or it will be too big
for the mailing list.</para>
<para>Re: punctuation and spelling</para>
<para>I was born and raised in England. I spent three years in the
USA, where I picked up some of the associated spelling, etc. Much
of Mondo's development took place in the US; so, rather than
confuse matters, I am keeping all source code and documentation in
US English. All criticisms should be made with that in mind.</para>
<para>When I was at school, the apostrophe would be present when
pluralizing an acronym - e.g. CD's, ISO's - but nowadays that is
considered old hat and even incorrect by some, which came as a
shock to me when I found out. It surprises me how quickly grammar,
spelling and punctuation have evolved even during my brief
liefetime. I am afraid I am still in the habit of writing CD's
instead of CDs. If you would like to draw my attention to
technical, grammatical or typographical errors, please feel free
but remember to couch your e-mail in language which shows you are
doing this out of a spirit of compassion for the poor sods who have
to read the documentation, not out of a spirit of pedantry.
