Description: powerful disaster recovery suite
 Mondo is reliable. It backs up your Debian GNU/Linux server or workstation to
 tape, CD-R, CD-RW, NFS or hard disk partition. In the event of catastrophic
 data loss, you will be able to restore all of your data [or as much as you
 want], from bare metal if necessary. Mondo is in use by numerous blue-chip
 enterprises and large organizations, dozens of smaller companies, and tens of
 thousands of users.
 .
 Mondo is comprehensive. Mondo supports LVM, RAID, ext2, ext3, JFS, XFS,
 ReiserFS, VFAT, and can support additional file systems easily. It supports
 adjustments in disk geometry, including migration from non-RAID to RAID. Mondo
 runs on all major Linux distributions and is getting better all the time. You
 may even use it to backup non-Linux partitions, such as NTFS.
 .
 IMPORTANT NOTE: This is the uostream version of mondo. Please do not report
