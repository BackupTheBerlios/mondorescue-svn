  <p><B>2006-02-05</B> Mondorescue has been officially referenced by the HP OpenSource Portal:
  <a href="http://opensource.hp.com/index.php">http://opensource.hp.com/index.php</a> (look in the "Recently released" area)</p>
  <p><B>2006-02-02</B> In our always increasing set of services :-) I'd like to announce the
availability of an rsync mirror service for mondo-rescue.

Try rsync rsync.mondorescue.org::</p>
  <p><B>2006-02-01</B> Things are progressing. I've gathered all the packages that were
  originally on <a href="http://www.mondorescue.org">http://www.mondorescue.org</a> and also added Mike's SuSE RPMs
+ all the latest packages I've produced and put them on a new ftp server
accessible at <a href="ftp://ftp.mondorescue.org">ftp://ftp.mondorescue.org</a>
</p><p>
You may have issues to access to it yet, as I've done a DNS refresh this
night and propagation could not be made everywhere now.

FYI:

</p><p>
$ host ftp.mondorescue.org<br>
ftp.mondorescue.org has address 213.30.161.23
</p><p>

The tree is:
</p><p>
level one distribution<br>
level two version number<br>
level three the packages

</p><p>
Feel free to send me (by private mail) packages that you have and that
are not in the repository, so that I can add them.

</p><p>
Thanks to HP and especially the HP/Intel Solution Center to help me
hosting the project.

Next step will be the Web site.</p>
