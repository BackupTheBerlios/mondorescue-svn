	<p>These 2 incredible guys have accepted to let us reuse the design they made for the not less incredible game <a href="http://www.frozen-bubble.org">Frozen Bubble</a>. Many thanks guys ! Just hope Mondo Rescue will help you some days as much as I played to frozen bubble myself :-)</p>
	<p>Don't miss Ayo's site at <a href="http://www.73lab.com">73lab.com</a> as it provides all his artworks, some of them reusable.
