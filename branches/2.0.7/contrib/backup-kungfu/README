backup-kungfu is a script made to ease the mondoarchive (http://www.mondorescue.com)
backup procedure for backing up 1 or more computers in the lan over the NFS.

	If you want the script to be executed on Daily/Weekly basis it's a good idea to

	# ln -s /usr/local/bin/backup-kungfu /etc/cron.daily/backup-kungfu
