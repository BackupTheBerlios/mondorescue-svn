  <P>
If you're reading this, it's for one of two reasons:-
<p>
1. You've clicked on the 'No logs? No help!' hyperlink just for run.
<br>
2. You were directed here by a member of the devteam.
<p>
The Support page makes it clear, in very large letters, that we (the devteam) cannot help you if you do not 
attach your log file to your e-mail or web-message. We know what we are talking about. We have been doing
this for quite a while now. Mondo generates a detailed log file to help you debug it or trace the cause of the
problem you are experiencing...but of course, you don't read it because you're a lazy-ass freeloader who
would rather sponge off other people's goodwill than do any work yourself.
<p>
Mondo has been in development since late 1999. It runs on dozens of Linux distros. There are three branches
in wide circulation. There are many different kernels out there, countless combinations of hardware,... yet you
expect us to be psychic, to figure out your problems without even sending us a 50k text file containing most of
the information you would send us if you could be bothered? Even though Mondo's documentation is peppered
with references to the log file and its importance, even though Mondo itself tells you to send the log file when
it aborts... you still didn't.
<p>
What kind of idiot are you?
<p>
The kind who doesn't like being confronted with it. It's like an alcoholic waking up in a pool of their own urine.
<p>
If you find this message offensive, you should try being faced with a dozen ignorant, lazy, stupid, pathetic,
ungrateful, complacent e-mails or web-messages like yours <i>every day</i>. Now, that's offensive. Bear in
mind that you didn't pay for this software. If you did, you wouldn't be so complacent as to treat the devteam
as your own person band of domestic servants.
<p>
Have a nice day.
