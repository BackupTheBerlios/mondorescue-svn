<para>Follow the on-screen instructions. This will compare your
backup against your original file system.</para>
<para>FYI, no bad archives have been created since May 2000. Having
said that, I would still encourage you to run Compare before
trusting the backups.</para>
<para>To view the file differences, look at the file
'/tmp/changed.txt'. Normal differences include logs and other
dynamic system files that changed during the time of the backup
process. If only a few files differ - e.g. files in /var, files
ending in '&amp;#732;', logs, temporary files, /etc/mtab,
/etc/adjtimex - then you know the archives are good. Your logs will
change over time, too. Bear in mind that a difference between the
backup and the live copy does not&nbsp;indicate a flaw in Mondo. It
indicates that you or your filesystem changed the files, so the
backup is no longer 100% up to date. However, that is inevitable,
as your filesystem changes from moment to moment (which is why you
back it up regularly).</para>
