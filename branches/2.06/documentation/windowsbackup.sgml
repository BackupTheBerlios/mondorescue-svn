<sect1 id="WINDOWSBACKU"><title>3.4. Windows Backup</title>
<para>Backing up windows partitions.</para>
<sect2 id="AEN13"><title>3.4.1. Windows ME/95/98</title>
<para>Verify that the partition is listed in /etc/fstab and is
mounted (e.g. /dev/hda1). Mondo will take care of everything else.
The files will be archived just like all other files in the live
file system. At restore-time, Mondo will take care of the boot
sector of /dev/hda1 prior to the restore.</para>
<para>Note: if Windows ME/95/98 is not located on /dev/hda1 or
/dev/sda1, then Mondo will not take care of the boot sector of
/dev/hda1. The user will have to boot from a DOS floppy and run SYS
C: to correct the Windows boot sector.</para>
</sect2><sect2 id="AEN13"><title>3.4.2. Windows NT4/2K/XP</title>
<para>Windows NT4/2K/XP typically use the NTFS file system, not
VFAT.. The user should use '-x /dev/hda1' (or whichever device the
Windows partition resides). Mondo will treat the partition as a
biggiefile. Mondo will also add an entry to the mountlist to
reflect the size and type of the partition. The user may not edit
that partition's size at restore-time (for obvious reasons).</para>
<para>Please bear in mind that Mondo was written for Linux users.
If Mondo does not backup or restore your Windows system well, you
might want to consider paying for 1-to-1 technical support.
Ironically, the only people to pay for 1-to-1 technical support
have been Linux users, whereas Windows users want a free ride. That
is one reason why the Linux community gives me warm fuzzies.</para>
